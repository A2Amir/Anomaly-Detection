# Anomaly-Detection
How to detect anomalies in a dataset
Anomaly detection has shown to be a valuable tool in a variety of application domains, e.g. detecting credit card fraud, network intrusion and sensor malfunction.

Anomalies are deﬁned as patterns in data that donot conform to expected or normal behaviour. The problem of ﬁnding such patterns is referred to as anomaly detection. Anomaly detection can be applied to any type of data,binary,discrete or continuous, univariate or multivariate.

 ## Types of anomalies
 
 
 There are mainly three types of anomalies,  
 
 
* point anomalies (global anomaly ):Point Anomalies If a single point deviates from the considered normal pattern it is referred to as a point anomaly. This is the simplest form of an anomaly and is the most researched form.

* sequential anomalies 
* contextual anomalies:
